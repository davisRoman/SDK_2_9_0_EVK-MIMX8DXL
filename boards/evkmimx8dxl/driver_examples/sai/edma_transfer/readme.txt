Overview
========
The sai_edma_transfer example shows how to use sai driver with EDMA:

In this example, one sai instance playbacks the audio data stored in flash/SRAM using EDMA channel.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.50.5
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.2.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MIMX8DXL EVK board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V power supply
- Personal Computer
- Headphone

Board settings
==============
Insert Headphone to J12.

#### Please note this application can't support running with Linux BSP! ####
This example aims to show the basic usage of the IP's function, some of the used Pads/Resources are also used by Cortex-A core.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board.
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J19 USB port on the cpu board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, you can hear the tone and the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SAI example started!
SAI EDMA example finished!
